# simple-canvas-captcha

Unsophisticated, shape-based CAPTCHA using HTML5 &lt;canvas>

Sample server is PHP but could be any old gubbins.

## TODO

* Reduce data length of hidden field that we submit with the form
* Add colour question as well? (but colour-blind people / contrast with background etc etc)
* Options to click the shape points as well / instead of answering the shape? (circle obviously excluded)
